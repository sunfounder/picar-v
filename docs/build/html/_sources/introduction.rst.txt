Introduction
============

The PiCar-V is developed based on the previous Smart Video Car Kit. Itâ€™s
equipped with the new PCA9685 PWM driver, smaller and better-performing
DC motor driver module, a Robot Hat with power and interface integrated,
a wider-angle camera with clearer vision, some better wheels and tires,
and so on. Later we'll check more details.

The basic functions of this new version still stay the same, including
controlling the PiCar-V remotely and streaming the video data it
captures back. Then what's new? Let's unveil the mysteries!
